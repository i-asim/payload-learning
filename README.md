# Payload CMS Learning Journal

This repository is dedicated to my journey of learning **Payload CMS** — a modern, developer-first headless CMS built on Node.js and Next.js. The purpose of this project is not to deliver a polished product right away, but to explore, experiment, and document each step as I grow more familiar with Payload’s features and workflows.

## 🎯 Purpose
- To practice setting up and working with Payload CMS locally.
- To understand how collections, fields, authentication, and APIs work.
- To experiment with integrations, deployment strategies, and customization.
- To keep a record of my progress, challenges, and solutions for future reference.

## 📖 Approach
- I will log my steps, notes, and experiments directly in this repository.
- Each milestone will be documented in Markdown files (e.g., `docs/01-installation.md`, `docs/02-collections.md`).
- The repo will serve as both a personal knowledge base and a reference for others who are curious about Payload CMS.

## 🚧 End Result
The final outcome of this project is **not planned in advance**. It may evolve into:
- A demo application
- A reusable starter kit
- Or simply a well-documented learning path

The focus is on **learning by doing** and sharing that process openly.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- [Payload CMS](https://payloadcms.com/)
- Node.js / Next.js
- Git & GitHub for version control and documentation

## ✨ Motivation
I’m eager to learn, experiment, and build. This repo is my sandbox — a place to try things out, make mistakes, and capture insights along the way.
